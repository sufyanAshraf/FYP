# Landmark Detection (FINAL YEAR PROJECT)
 
While traveling people are very curious to explore new places. Some of the time they do not know the landmark that they are visiting or most of the people take pictures in front of the famous landmarks, but they donâ€™t know about it. This software will help the people to know the name and information of those landmarks. The application is tailored towards the tourist who wants to go to historical places and try the cuisine. The recommendation of places to visit next and food to try is also added in the application. The software is an android application. The user is able to take a picture of the objects and that will be automatically sent for the processing which then gives name and information about that landmark.
